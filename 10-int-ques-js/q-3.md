#Question 3

**What is the difference between classical inheritance and prototypal inheritance?**

I gave an example of Prototypal Inheritance in [question 1.](./q-1.md) So I will explain classical inheritance here, along with some of the reasons to prefer prototypal inheritance.

Since JavaScript does not have a native class inheritance mechanism, this design pattern is introduced using functions and the `new` keyword. Recreating the prototypal inheritance example in [question 1](./q-1.md) would look like this

```javascript
function Monster() {
  // Give a base attack to all monsters
  this.baseAttack = function(target) {
    console.log(`${target} loses 5 hp`);
  } 
}

// Create a subclass of Monster
let ogre = new Monster();

// Add specific functionality to ogre
ogre.specialAttack = function(target) {
  console.log(`${target} loses 20 hp`);
}

ogre.baseAttack('Mage'); // Mage loses 5 hp
ogre.specialAttack('Rogue'); // Rogue loses 20 hp

```
Classes are typically thought to create a copy of a behavior from the parent class to the child. This is not how it works in JavaScript. It actually just links the prototypes together. So, when a method or property is not found on one it continually searches the prototype chain until the object or property is found or the end of the chain is reached.

Prototypal inheritance can be thought of as sibling objects linked together by a protope chain.
