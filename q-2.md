#Question 2

**What is functional programming?**
Some of the core concepts of functional programming are:

1. The ability to abstract mulitple tasks (functions) into small and composable parts, and chain the simple functions together to complete a complex task.

`let newArr = [1,2,3].map((num) => num + 1).filter((num) => return num < 3);`
2. Functions should have as little side effects as possible. Immutability should be preferred.
3. Functions should be pure. Given the same input a function should always return the same output.
3. Functions can be passed as arguments to another function and be the return value of other functions.
